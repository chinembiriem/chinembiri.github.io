## Projects
### IoT-Enabled Precision Agriculture: Machine Learning-Driven Fertilizer Optimization for Smallholder Farmers in Zimbabwe via Real-Time Soil Health Monitoring!

A low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) prototype that integrates RS485 soil sensors to gather real-time data on nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and pH levels from smallholder farms in Zimbabwe, in collaboration with the Department of Research and Specialist Services (DR&SS). The system employs a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model, enhanced with decision tree algorithms, to analyze both sensor data and historical records from DR&SS. This analysis aims to generate adaptive fertilizer recommendations that consider seasonal variability and agroecological diversity. Additionally, the precision of the MLP model will be validated against laboratory benchmarks and traditional fertilizer recommendation systems, ensuring its reliability and effectiveness in optimizing fertilizer use for improved agricultural outcomes.
